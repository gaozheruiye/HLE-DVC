# The implementation of the HLE-DVC
USENIX 2026

The project can run on both Windows and Linux environments (Ubuntu version 20.04 or higher).

This project is built on the Python binding of the mcl library, 
which is originally implemented in Go. While the underlying library is written in Go, our project itself is implemented in Python.


The main.py in this folder can be executed directly, while the core code and key functions are implemented in the PCS_group.py.
Most of the remaining files are utility modules used to support polynomial operations.
